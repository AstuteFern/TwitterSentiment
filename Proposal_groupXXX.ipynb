    "# Abstract \n",
    "In this project, we aim to advance customer satisfaction within the US airline industry using customer feedback in the form of Tweets. The data used is made up of ~14600 observations across 15 variables and includes information about the airline mentioned, the tweet, the sentiment of the tweet, and other relevant factors. We plan on converting the customer feedback into a numerical form through the utilization of NLP techniques such as TF-IDF. We can then use K-means or GMM clustering to group the customer feedback data into clusters, each of which represents a different sentiment. We will then further cluster these separated sentiments to analyze different areas to work on(negative feedback)  or to keep the same(positive feedback) for the airlines. Our goal is to gain insight into sentiments regarding various features of airlines to improve overall customer satisfaction. We measure the performance of the algorithm by using methods like the silhouette score and PCA visualization to see how clean our clusters look."

    "Fill in the background and discuss the kind of prior work that has gone on in this research area here. **Use inline citation** to specify which references support which statements.  You can do that through HTML footnotes (demonstrated here). I used to reccommend Markdown footnotes (google is your friend) because they are simpler but recently I have had some problems with them working for me whereas HTML ones always work so far. So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are trying to solve is to improve customer satisfaction of customers using US Airlines. We decided to use clustering algorithms to form clusters of customer feedback data pulled from Twitter which are directed at various airlines operating in America. We then aim to identify clusters of different sentiments, which we can use to provide insight as to which airlines have the most satisfied customers and which areas each airline needs to work on to increase customer satisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is quantifiable because we can apply NLP to convert the text input into a numerical form. We can then input that numeric form into ML algorithms and extract data from there. We can use NLP techniques like TF-IDF and then use the data we get from there in our clustering algorithms such as K-Means or GMM clustering. The problem is measurable because we can measure how well our clustering has worked using metrics such as the silhouette score, which measures the cohesion and separation of the clusters. Further, the performance of the clustering algorithm can also be assessed visually using PCA by observing how well it groups customer feedback into distinct sentiments and themes in those respective sentiments. The problem is also replicable since customer feedback is a field that is always increasing in size and sentiment analysis can be performed on the newer data to monitor changes in customer sentiment and satisfaction over time. When the newer data is collected, the new data can be fed into the clustering model which can readjust itself to identify shifts in customer sentiment, ensuring airlines can be up to date on the changing customer expectations."

    "\n",
