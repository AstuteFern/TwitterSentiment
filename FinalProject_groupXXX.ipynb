    "Reports should have a __narrative__. Once you've looked through all your results over the quarter, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Include the detailed code and analysis results of those points only; you should spend more time/code/plots on your main point than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you went down any blind alleys that you later decided to not pursue, please don't abuse the TAs time by throwing in 81 lines of code and 4 plots related to something you actually abandoned.  Consider deleting things that are not important to your narrative.  If its slightly relevant to the narrative or you just want us to know you tried something, you could keep it in by summarizing the result in this report in a sentence or two, moving the actual analysis to another file in your repo, and providing us a link to that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection 1\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely have different subsections as you go through your report. For instance you might start with an analysis of the dataset/problem and from there you might be able to draw out the kinds of algorithms that are / aren't appropriate to tackle the solution.  Or something else completely if this isn't the way your project works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Another likely section is if you are doing any feature selection through cross-validation or hand-design/validation of features/transformations of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably you need to describe the base model and demonstrate its performance.  Maybe you include a learning curve to show whether you have enough data to do train/validate/test split or have to go to k-folds or LOOCV or ???\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps some exploration of the model selection (hyper-parameters) or algorithm selection task. Validation curves, plots showing the variability of perfromance across folds of the cross-validation, etc. If you're doing one, the outcome of the null hypothesis test or parsimony principle check to show how you are selecting the best model.\n",

    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project has obvious potential concerns with ethics or data privacy discuss that here.  Almost every ML project put into production can have ethical implications if you use your imagination. Use your imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you can't come up with an obvious ethical concern that should be addressed, you should know that a large number of ML projects that go into producation have unintended consequences and ethical problems once in production. How will your team address these issues?\n",

    "Consider a tool to help you address the potential issues such as https://deon.drivendata.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
